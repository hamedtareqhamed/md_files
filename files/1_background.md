# Part 1: Background of Language

### 1.1 History of the Language

**Origin:**
Dart was invented by Google and initially unveiled in 2011 (released 1.0 in 2013) by **Lars Bak** and **Kasper Lund**. **[1]**

**Reason for Invention:**
It was originally invented to address the limitations of JavaScript for modern web development. Google engineers wanted a language that was more structured, scalable, and performant for large-scale web applications. **[1]**

**Evolution:**
While it started as a web-focused language, its popularity surged in **2018** with the release of **Flutter**, Google's UI toolkit. This shifted Dart's primary focus toward becoming a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform (mobile, web, desktop). **[2]**

### 1.2 Language Category & Programming Styles

**Category:**
Dart falls primarily under the **Imperative / Procedural** category. Its central features are variables, assignment statements, and iteration. **[3]**

**Programming Styles:**
Dart is a **multi-paradigm** language that supports:
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Everything in Dart is an object (class-based). **[4]**
* **Functional Programming:** It supports high-level functional concepts, such as passing functions as arguments. **[5]**

### 1.3 Types of Applications & Sample Usage

**Target Domains:**
Dart and Flutter are mostly used for Cross-Platform Mobile Applications (iOS and Android from a single codebase). However, they are also used for Web Apps and Desktop Software. **[6]**

**Sample Applications:**
* **Google Ads:** A mobile app used by millions to manage ad campaigns.
* **Xianyu (by Alibaba):** One of the largest e-commerce apps in China.
* **Reflectly:** A popular AI-based journaling application.
* **BMW App:** The companion app for vehicle owners.

### 1.4 Popularity & Statistics

**Current Status:**
At present, Dart is a dominant language in mobile development because it powers the Flutter framework.

**Statistics:**
Because Dart allows companies to create apps for iOS, Android, and Web, at the same time, according to both the **TIOBE Index of 2025 [14]** and **Stack Overflow Developer Surveys [13]**, it has grown very fast.

**Adoption:**
Major global firms like **BMW [9]**, **Toyota**, and **Google Pay [11]** have made a switch to Dart for their mobile apps in an effort to cut costs and boost speed.

### 1.5 Implementation Method (Dual Compilation)

Dart stands out because it uses a "Dual Compilation" model. It uses two different methods depending on if you are developing or publishing **[10]**:

| Phase | Compiler Type | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Development** | **JIT** (Just-In-Time) | Enables **"Hot Reload"**. It allows developers to change the code (like fixing a typo or changing a color) and see the result on the screen instantly in less than a second without restarting the app or losing their place. |
| **Production** | **AOT** (Ahead-Of-Time) | Translates the entire app into native machine code before the user downloads it. Because of this, Dart enables a very quick, non-delayed response time. |

### 1.6 Programming Environments

1.  **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** Probably the most popular editor for Dart. It is lightweight and free.
2.  **Android Studio:** Google's official software for the creation of mobile apps. It includes heavy tools for memory and performance checks.
3.  **DartPad:** A web-based platform where you can write and run Dart code in your browser without installation. **[10]**
4.  **Xcode:** the only environment that can build **iOS** apps. **[15]**
