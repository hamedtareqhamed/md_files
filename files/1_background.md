# Part 1: Background of Language

### 1.1 History of the Language

**Origin:**
Dart was invented by Google and initially unveiled in 2011 (released 1.0 in 2013) by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund (Bak, 2011).
**Reason for Invention:**
Dart was originally invented to address the limitations of JavaScript for modern web development. Google engineers wanted a language that was more structured, scalable, and performant for large-scale web applications (Bak, 2011).

**Evolution:**
While it started as a web-focused language, its popularity surged in 2018 with the release of **Flutter**, Google's UI toolkit. This shifted Dart's primary focus toward becoming a client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform (mobile, web, desktop) (Zee Palm, 2024).

## 1.2 Language Category & Programming Styles

**Category:**
Dart falls primarily under the Imperative / Procedural category. Its central features are variables, assignment statements, and iteration (Sebesta, 2015).

**Programming Styles:**
Dart is a multi-paradigm language that supports:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Everything in Dart is an object (class-based) structure (GeeksforGeeks, 2025).
It supports high-level functional concepts, such as passing functions as arguments (Uppar, 2025).

### 1.3 Types of Applications & Sample Usage

**Target Domains:**
Dart and Flutter framework are mostly used for Cross-Platform Mobile Applications (iOS and Android from a single codebase). However, they are also used for Web Apps and Desktop Software (Dart, n.d.).

**Sample Applications:**
* **Google Ads:** A mobile app used by millions to manage ad campaigns.
* **Xianyu (by Alibaba):** One of the largest e-commerce apps in China.
* **Reflectly:** A popular AI-based journaling application.
* **BMW App:** The companion app for vehicle owners.
(Litslink, 2025; Nomtek, 2024).

### 1.4 Popularity & Statistics

**Current Status:**
At present, Dart is a dominant language in mobile development because it powers the Flutter framework.

**Statistics:**
Because Dart allows companies to create apps for iOS, Android, and Web, at the same time, according to both the TIOBE Index (2025) and Stack Overflow Developer Survey (2025), it has grown very fast.

**Adoption:**
Major global firms like BMW, Toyota, and Google Pay have made a switch to Dart for their mobile apps in an effort to cut costs and boost speed (BMW Group, n.d.; Google, n.d.).


### 1.5 Implementation Method (Dual Compilation)

Dart stands out because it uses a "Dual Compilation" model. It uses two different methods depending on if you are developing or publishing **[10]**:

| Phase | Compiler Type | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Development** | **JIT** (Just-In-Time) | Enables **"Hot Reload"**. It allows developers to change the code (like fixing a typo or changing a color) and see the result on the screen instantly in less than a second without restarting the app or losing their place. |
| **Production** | **AOT** (Ahead-Of-Time) | Translates the entire app into native machine code before the user downloads it. Because of this, Dart enables a very quick, non-delayed response time. |

### 1.6 Programming Environments

1.  **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** Probably the most popular editor for Dart. It is lightweight and free.
2.  **Android Studio:** Google's official software for the creation of mobile apps. It includes heavy tools for memory and performance checks.
3.  **DartPad:** A web-based platform where you can write and run Dart code in your browser without installation. **
4.  **Xcode:** the only environment that can build **iOS** apps.
